# Overview

The AI SDK was heavily inspired by the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) built by the Vercel team. This SDK is
a partial port of that JavaScript SDK to Python.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ai-sdk-python
```

## Usage

The AI SDK is designed to make it easy to work with different AI providers whether that is to generate text
or structured outputs. All you need to do is import the library and call the `generate_text` function to get
started:

```python
from ai_sdk import generate_text
from ai_sdk.openai import openai

response = generate_text(
    model=openai("gpt-4o"),
    prompt="Hello, world!"
)

print(response.text)
```

You can learn more about using the AI SDK in our guides:
