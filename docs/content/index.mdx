The Python AI SDK is heavily inspired (ie. a port) of the awesome
[AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) built by [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

I have been a big fan of the Vercel AI SDK and have always wanted to use
it as part of my Python projects and decided to recreate it in Python.

## Getting started

To get started, simply follow the steps:

<Steps>
### Install the package

You can install the Python AI SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install ai-sdk-python
```

### Making your first LLM call

Once the package is installed, you can make your first LLM call using the `generate_text` function:

```python
from ai_sdk import generate_text
from ai_sdk.openai import openai

response = generate_text(
    model=openai("gpt-4o"),
    prompt="Hello, world!"
)

print(response.text)
```

### Adding tracing

The Python AI SDK supports tracing which means you can save all your LLM calls for future analysis.

For this, the AI SDK relies on the [Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik) library. To get started,
the only thing you need to do is configure the Opik library:

```bash
opik.configure()
```
